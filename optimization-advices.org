Your code seems to be well-structured and organized, but there are a few areas where you can optimize it:

1. **Use functions more effectively**: You have already defined some utility functions like `disp_calculations`, `disp_tex_list`, and `replace_and_write`, which is great. However, you can further modularize your code by creating separate functions for tasks that are repeated across multiple scenes, such as creating the `title`, `intro_tex`, `question`, and `multiple_choice` objects. This will make your code more readable and maintainable.

2. **Utilize inheritance**: Instead of rewriting common setup code for each scene, you can create a base class that handles the common setup and inherit from it in your individual scenes. This way, you can reduce code duplication and make it easier to make changes that affect multiple scenes.

3. **Use list comprehensions and generators**: You can use list comprehensions and generators to create lists more concisely. For example, instead of using a loop to create `intro_tex`, you can use a list comprehension:

```python
intro_tex = [Tex(i).scale(0.75).next_to(title1, DOWN) for i in intro]
```

Similarly, you can use generators in `replace_and_write` to improve performance when working with large lists.

4. **Optimize imports**: Instead of importing the entire `manim` module, you can import only the necessary classes and functions from their respective submodules. This can improve performance and reduce the memory footprint of your code.

5. **Avoid unnecessary calculations**: In some cases, you may be performing calculations that are not necessary. For example, in `replace_and_write`, you can check if `lines_and_scales` is empty before iterating over it, which can save some computation time.

6. **Utilize Manim's built-in animations and mobjects**: Manim provides many built-in animations and mobjects that can simplify your code. For example, instead of creating a `MobjectMatrix` and then extracting the entries, you can use `IntegerMatrix` or `Matrix` directly.

7. **Consider using configuration files**: If you have a lot of constants or global settings that are shared across multiple scenes, you can store them in a configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) and load them at runtime. This can make it easier to manage and update these settings without modifying the code.

8. **Optimize rendering performance**: If you're experiencing performance issues during rendering, you can try reducing the resolution or frame rate, or consider using Manim's Cairo renderer instead of the OpenGL renderer, which can be more efficient for certain types of animations.

Overall, your code is well-structured, but by implementing these optimizations, you can make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
